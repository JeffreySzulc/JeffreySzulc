## 🥷 About Me

I'm a recent IT graduate from NJIT, a data science explorer, and a martial arts instructor with a deep love for efficiency, precision, and growth.

Just like in Isshinryu Karate, where every movement is practical and powerful, I believe tech should be smart, clean, and adaptable. I bring a disciplined, fast-learning mindset to everything I do — whether it's backend clustering or building data pipelines.
